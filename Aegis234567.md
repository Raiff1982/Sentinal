# Aegis234567 Package Overview

This document contains the full drop-in package with the hoax/misinformation filter, extended allow/deny lists, CLI, and tests. All code is real and integrated into the Sentinal project.

## Modules
- `hoax_filter.py`: Lightweight, stateless misinformation heuristics for language/source/scale
- `nexis_signal_engine.py`: Signal engine for processing, memory, and verdicts
- `hoax_scan.py`: CLI for scanning text and sources
- `test_hoax_filter.py`: Unit tests for filter and engine

## Usage Examples
### Quick Start
```bash
python -m unittest sentinal/test_hoax_filter.py -v
python sentinal/hoax_scan.py --db signals.db --source "https://m.facebook.com/foo" "Recently declassified footage shows a 2,000 miles long object near Saturn's rings"
```

### Programmatic
```python
from sentinal.nexis_signal_engine import NexisSignalEngine
engine = NexisSignalEngine(memory_path="signals.db")
text = "Recently declassified footage shows a 2,000 miles long object near Saturn's rings"
res = engine.process_news(text, source_url="https://m.facebook.com/foo")
print(res["verdict"], res["misinfo_heuristics"])
```

### Thresholds
- `combined >= 0.70` → blocked
- `0.45–0.69` → adaptive intervention
- else → keep base verdict

## Notes
- All code is now in the appropriate Python modules in the Sentinal project.
